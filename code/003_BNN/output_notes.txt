000: 100ms, XOR signal always on
001: 50ms XOR signal, measure h after 600ms

1XX: pre connection matrix fix, all unassigned neurons were being assigned to cluster 0.
2XX: post connection matrix fix

For cluster-level model, h_I would go up to around 250

3XX: Fixed dt off-by-one (assuming dt was 1ms when it was actually 0.1ms)

4XX: Testing with random weights for 50 extended neurons 
"The following is the model behaving in the correct regime, with random initialisation of computation weights with std=0.1.
Both tests had a small number of computational neurons compared to paper neurons, and did not enforce negative W weights."
1000 paper neurons, 50 extended
