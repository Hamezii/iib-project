000: 100ms, XOR signal always on
001: 50ms XOR signal, measure h after 600ms

1XX: pre connection matrix fix, all unassigned neurons were being assigned to cluster 0.
2XX: post connection matrix fix

For cluster-level model, h_I would go up to around 250

3XX: Fixed dt off-by-one (assuming dt was 1ms when it was actually 0.1ms)
