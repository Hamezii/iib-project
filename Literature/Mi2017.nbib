AB  - Psychological studies indicate that human ability to keep information in readily 
      accessible working memory is limited to four items for most people. This 
      extremely low capacity severely limits execution of many cognitive tasks, but its 
      neuronal underpinnings remain unclear. Here we show that in the framework of 
      synaptic theory of working memory, capacity can be analytically estimated to 
      scale with characteristic time of short-term synaptic depression relative to 
      synaptic current time constant. The number of items in working memory can be 
      regulated by external excitation, enabling the system to be tuned to the desired 
      load and to clear the working memory of currently held items to make room for new 
      ones.
